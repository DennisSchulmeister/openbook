    Just like Node.js packages (which the OpenBook libraries usually are), libraries may depend
    on other libraries without which they cannot be used. Unfortunately we cannot use the declared
    dependencies of the `package.json` file for this as it mostly points to Node.js packages that
    will be included in the generated library bundle.

    Instead, dependencies between OpenBook libraries are declared in the `library.yml` file and
    uploaded into this database model. This allows the server to perform at least some basic
    dependency checks during installation to see that all required other libraries have also
    been installed. It also allows the server to warn the user in case a library that is needed
    by another library is de-installed.
