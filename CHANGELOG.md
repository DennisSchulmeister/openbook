OpenBook Studio: Changelog
==========================

2024-08-06: Development started
-------------------------------

The plan to reimplement and extend the old lecture-slides.js application is not at least
two years old. :-) Now that I want to extend the application with some basic feedback
elements (to collect feedback from students to improve my course materials) I finally
have an excuse to start this project.

Initial development will be slow. Initially I only want to implement the backend functionality
for feedback surveys and integrate this in my existing materials. But while doing so I want
to lay the groundwork for the following re-implemenation, leveraging the scaffolding I did
for Lernspiel Online (another platform I wanted to start for a long time).
