OpenBook Studio: Development Ideas
==================================

Even though the precursor to OpenBook Studio - lecture-slides.js - has been around
since 2017, development of this successor is still in the very early stages.
The following list contains a few very high-level ideas on what we want to work
in the future in no particular order.

Want to pick up a topic or plan a project with your students? We are looking forward
to hearing from you. Let's get in contact. :-)

* Modern redesign of the old lecture-slides.js library
* Modern redesign of the old ls-xyz plugins (using a light-weight web component framework)
* WYSIWYG online editor to edit textbooks directly in the browser
* Running textbooks directly from the textbook server
* Static export of textbooks for deployment on a static web server / upload in a learning management system
* Import and export of textbooks as ZIP bundles for backups and migration to another server
* Many more content plugins :-)
* Possibility for students to make annotations and notes in the textbook
* Graded learning quizes with server backend (know which student scored in which test)
* Anonymous learning statistics (how many of a course have read which pages?)
