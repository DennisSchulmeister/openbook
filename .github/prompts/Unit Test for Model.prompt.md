Please suggest unit tests for the Model `XYZ`.

* Use class `django.test.TestCase`
* Write a docstring for the class, e.g.:  "Tests for the `MyModel` model."
* Keep method names short and concise, e.g.: "test_role_assigned_on_accept"
* Write a short and concise docstring for each method, e.g.: "Role should be assigned when access request is accepted."
* If needed write a `setUp` method to create any necessary objects or data.
* The `setUp` method needs no docstring.
* You need not test the `__str__` method.
