We use poetry to manage our Python dependencies. So when talking about
Python dependencies, please use the `poetry` command.

We always write strings with double quotes, unless the strings include
double quotes themselves. In that case, we use single quotes.

In all programming languages we use four spaces for indentation.

In Python we often use the `from x import y` syntax. When importing from
the same Django app, we use a relative import like `from .models import MyModel`.

Comments use markdown syntax. Programming language keywords, variables
etc. are wrapped in backticks, e.g. `my_variable`.

We use empty lines to separate logical blocks of code. So please try to
avoid writing long blocks of code without empty lines.
