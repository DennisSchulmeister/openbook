    """
    Customized version of the stock model authentication backend. For normal permission checks
    without an object it behaves exactly the same. Object permissions are checked in the following
    order, stopping at the first match:

    1. The user is a superuser
    2. The user and the object are the same
    3. The user is the object's `owner` (optional).
    4. The object's `has_obj_perm()` method (optional).
    5. Regular non-object permissions
    
    Superusers can do anything. Users can change their own data. The owner is always authorized.
    Otherwise role-based permissions are checked. If this is not supported by the object or fails,
    we fall back to regular user permissions. Thus, the `ModelBackend` doesn't need to be included
    in the Django settings, as its function is already covered here.
