    To allow upgrading the installed libraries without modifying the server installation and also
    to allow 3rd-parties to provide additional libraries the server provides a "library repository"
    similar in spirit to PyPi or npmjs. But here the OpenBook server is both server and client.
    As a server it can publish libraries and other installations can download and install as a client.
    Additionally clients can retrieve version upgrades from the publishing server.

    This model defines which of the installed libraries are published by the server. The central
    `https://openbook.studio` installation publishes the core libraries. Other installations should
    therefore only publish their own self-developed libraries.
