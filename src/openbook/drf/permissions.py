    Class `APIView`, which is a parent for `ModelViewSet` in Django REST Framework the method
    `check_permissions()` is called very early and later `check_object_permissions()`, too.
    Since `DjangoObjectPermissions` is a `DjangoModelPermissions` it implements both checks.
    But DRF raises an exception when either method returns `False`, thus inverting the logic
    in our own authentication backend. Also both classes don't check "view" permissions by default.

    This class replaces `DjangoObjectPermissions` with a version more in line with our own backend.
