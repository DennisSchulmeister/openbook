    Improved version of the stock `ModelAdmin` that checks object-permissions instead of
    the regular model-permissions. The only difference is, that `obj` will be set to the
    object to be viewed/changed/deleted, when the permission is checked.
    
    This relies on our custom authentication backend to fallback to regular permissions
    checks when the object doesn't support object-permissions or the object-based permission
    check fails.

        The parent class calls `has_add_permission()` in `_changeform_view()` just before the form
        data is validated and saved, but doesn't have the new object, yet. Therefor `has_add_permission()`
        lacks the `obj` parameter. This method is called after the validation to actually save the object.
        As a hacky workaround we catch up on the permission check here.
