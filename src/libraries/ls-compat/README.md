OpenBook / Library / ls-compat
==============================

This is a compatibility library that will allow to reuse learning material built with the old
[lecture-slides.js](https://github.com/DennisSchulmeister/lecture-slides.js) application with
OpenBook. It reimplements all the `ls-…` and `lsx-…` custom elements with Svelte. Most content
should hopefully work out of the box with this.
