/**
 * Centralized esbuild configuration to build JavaScript assets. This is used
 * by the higher-level build scripts which find the source files and determine
 * what destination files need to be created.
 *
 * There must be exactly one source file that imports all other files to be
 * included in the build. Normally a single bundle will be created from that.
 * For the libraries we however support creating multiple identical bundles
 * at different locations. Bundles always consist of a *.js and *.css file
 * plus copied over static files.
 *
 * @param infile {string} Full path of the main source file
 * @param outfiles {string[]} Full path of all bundle files to be created
 * @param staticdir {string} Path with static files to be copied (optional)
 * @param watch {bool} Keep running and rebuild on file changes (optional)
